 Hey all, 
 In this file we have a game engine we created in-class and a small Interactive Fiction game.
 A lot of this game was built using a backbone that our teacher, Mr. Francis, made for us so that we may begin exploring our creative interests. The only directions are North, East, South, and West, but there are plenty of rooms to explore! Typing 'Quit' will get you out of the program immediately if you run into a death sequence or you just really hate the game!
